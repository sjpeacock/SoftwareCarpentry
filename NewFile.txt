This is a new file that I'd like to add to my online repository.
OK, now I'm making changes to this file online.

Now I am adding some more text, and I'm going to try and branch the file (or repository?? Not sure how this works...)

OK, I want to keep this file from BranchTrial, and then merge this text back with the master.

Done! I haven't deleted BranchTrial though....

Let's see if we can deal with conflicting changes!

Can we do it?  Can we?  I'm gonna be optimistic and say YES!
